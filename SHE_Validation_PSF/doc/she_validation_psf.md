# SHE Validation

## PSF Validation Test Descriptions

### PSF Model Validation

#### Requirement: R-SHE-PRD-F-100:

Parent: R-GDP-DL3-014 The distribution of χ2 (chi-squared) values for each star with respect to the model, over the
population of stars, shall be consistent (TBD) with the χ2-distribution.

[ANT: TBD to be removed in SHE RSD]

#### Requirement Comment from GDPRD

This shall be demonstrated by estimating the chi-squared distribution of stellar residuals with respect to the PSF
model.

Requirements Chain: TBD

#### Validation Test: T-SHE-000001-PSF-res-star-pos

Estimate PSF model residuals at star positions and compare with suitable expected distribution (e.g. chi^2) with e.g. KL
test (ANT: should this be KS-test?)

This test is defined in the WL Validation doc in VAL-WL-SHE-0010.

[ANT: The use of chi^2 here has been questioned. In practise we will probably use the distribution of residuals from simulations of the PSF recovery. This distribution will have to generated by a new PE. ]

[ANT: The test refers to a KL test. KL is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which does measure the difference between 2 distributions, but there is no obvious threshold. I'd suggest a KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) Test is what was meant here.]

#### Rational:

To verify that the object PSF model residuals are consistent with noise, i.e., that there are no remaining systematics
in the PSF model.

#### Test Case:

TC-SHE-100001-PSF-res-star-pos-tot χ2 distribution of χ2 values of PSF residuals at star positions of total population

##### Test Procedure:

1. This process is carried out on real and simulated Euclid
   Observations. [ANT:The test on simulated images will require data from SIM.]
1. This test is carried out per Observation.
1. Use each star used in the PSF Fitting (use PHZ or SHE flags).
1. From the residuals between the PSF image to the PSF model, calculate the χ2 for each star.
1. Estimate the distribution of the χ2-values on a per-exposure basis.
1. Compute difference between distribution and theoretical χ2 distribution.

#### Test Case:

TC-SHE-100002-PSF-res-star-pos-SNR χ2 distribution of χ2 values of PSF residuals at star positions as function of SNR.

##### Test Procedure:

1. This process is carried out on real and simulated Euclid Observations.
1. This test is carried out per Observation.
1. Stars are binned by SNR (bin size, range?).
1. Use each star (how selected? PHZ or SHE flag?) in each SNR bin used in the PSF Fitting.
1. From the residuals between the PSF image to the PSF model, calculate the χ2 for each star.
1. Estimate the distribution of the χ2-values on a per-exposure basis.
1. Compute difference between distribution and theoretical χ2 distribution.

#### Test Case:

TC-SHE-100002-PSF-res-star-pos-SED As for the TC-SHE-100002-PSF-res-star-pos-SNR test with SNR replaced by SED.

#### Test Case:

TC-SHE-100002-PSF-res-star-pos-pix As for the TC-SHE-100002-PSF-res-star-pos-SNR test with SNR replaced by pixel
coordinates.

#### Test Case:

TC-SHE-100002-PSF-res-star-pos-epoch As for the TC-SHE-100002-PSF-res-star-pos-SNR test with SNR replaced by epoch.

#### Test Case:

TC-SHE-100002-PSF-res-star-pos-solaspang As for the TC-SHE-100002-PSF-res-star-pos-SNR test with SNR replaced by solar
aspect angle.
