# SHE_Validation

The documentation for this project is stored in the `doc` folder of this project. This documentation is compilable by
Elements, and best viewed in the compiled version. This can be accessed either by:

* Accessing the documentation for a deployed version through CODEEN. For the develop version, this is available
  at: https://codeen.euclid-ec.org/jenkins/view/SHE/job/SHE_Validation/job/develop/Documentation
* Accessing the documentation on GitLab at https://gitlab.euclid-sgs.uk/PF-SHE/SHE_Validation/-/tree/develop/doc with
  your browser of choice. Note that due to limitations of compiling ``.rst`` files on GitLab, this version will not
  display Tables of Contents which reference other files, and links to other files will not function properly. To use links to
  other files on Gitlab, copy the target address, paste it into your address bar, and at the end where it says `/<target>.html`
  replace it with `/doc/<target>.rst`.
* Downloading the repository and compiling the documentation locally. This can be done through the following commands:
  ```bash
  cd ${HOME}/Work/Projects git clone https://gitlab.euclid-sgs.uk/PF-SHE/SHE_Validation.git
  cd SHE_Validation git checkout <desired branch or tag>
  make
  ```
  This will make the documentation available in the
  directory `${HOME}/Work/Projects/SHE_Validation/build.x86_64-conda_cos6-gcc73-o2g/doc/sphinx/html/`. The
  page `index.html` in this directory will be the main page for the documentation, and can be opened with your browser
  of choice (e.g. `firefox`) to view the compiled documentation.

Otherwise, the documentation can be read uncompiled.
