Overview
========

    ``This, is an example of a header section, the aim is to briefly describe with a few sentences what the repository does.``
    ``This is heavily based on what Lee did for PK-WL before he left and it was very efficient for other devs to pick up from where he left``

This very simple repository aims to create a template for documentation
which will be automatically compiled into html for Euclid-SGS Projects when
built on CODEEN or when ``make doc`` is called. On CODEEN, the compiled
documentation can be accessed through the link on the left panel on the page
for each branch after being built. When built locally with ``make doc``, the
documentation can be accessed through opening the generated ``index.html``
file (which can be found in the build.../doc/sphinx directory) with your browser of
choice.
