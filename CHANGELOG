Changelog for SHE_Validation

Changes in v9.1
=========================

API Changes
-----------
- Renamed executable SHE_Validation_ValidatePSFRes to SHE_Validation_ValidatePSFResStarPos, to avoid ambiguity with
  future PSFResInterp executable
- Added new executable SHE_Validation_ValidatePSFRes
  - Main executable and interface implemented
  - Reading in of input data implemented
  - Processing of data implemented
  - Reporting of results to in-memory data product implemented
  - Resulting data product output
  - Added ability to configure p-value for failure threshold
  - Added option for comparison against a reference product. Test will check if provided product is consistent with or
    better than reference product if one is provided. If one isn't provided, test will check if chi-sq probabilities are
    consistent with uniform distribution.
- Bin limits can now be provided (at the command-line or via pipeline_config file) in the format "auto-N" (where N is a
  positive integer). This will be interpreted as "Automatically generate bin limits from the data, by separating it
  N quantiles (of equal data volume)." The default is now "auto-4" for all parameters, which splits the data into
  quartiles.
- Bin limits can now be specified separately for different executables (e.g. if you wish to use different SNR bin
  limits for the PSF Residual (Star Position) test and the CTI-Galaxy test). Each executable now has its own set of
  pipeline_config keys for its own bin limits. If these are supplied, they'll be used; otherwise the old, "global" keys
  will be used. See each executable's documentation for lists of the new keys

Deprecated Features
-------------------


Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed a bug in CTI-Gal test where plots were only being saved for one exposure, now generates for all exposures and
  full observation properly
- Fixed a bug where sometimes the CTI-Gal input data could be run without the MDB being inited.


New Features

- Refactored code to move generation of mock data and tables for unit testing to SHE_PPT
- Added documentation for new executable SHE_Validation_ValidatePSFResStarPos
- Version number is now determined in the code directly from what's in the CMakeLists.txt file, and no longer needs to
  be maintained separately
